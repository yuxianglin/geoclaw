! !ROUTINE: next_observation_pdaf --- Initialize information on next observation
!
! !INTERFACE:
SUBROUTINE next_observation_pdaf(stepnow, nsteps_pdaf, doexit, time)

! !DESCRIPTION:
! User-supplied routine for PDAF.
! Used in the filters: SEEK/SEIK/EnKF/LSEIK/ETKF/LETKF/ESTKF/LESTKF
!
! The subroutine is called before each forecast phase
! by PDAF\_get\_state. It has to initialize the number 
! of time steps until the next available observation 
! (nsteps_pdaf) and the current model time (time). In 
! addition the exit flag (exit) has to be initialized.
! It indicates if the data assimilation process is 
! completed such that the ensemble loop in the model 
! routine can be exited.
!
! The routine is called by all processes. 
!         
! Version for the dummy model. Identical for
! mode- and domain-decomposition .
!
! !REVISION HISTORY:
! 2004-10 - Lars Nerger - Initial code
! Later revisions - see svn log

! !USES:
  USE mod_assimilation, &
       ONLY: delt_obs, mod_time => time, have_obs
  USE mod_parallel, &
       ONLY: mype_world
  USE mod_model, &
       ONLY: total_steps, dt => dtinit

  IMPLICIT NONE

! !ARGUMENTS:
  INTEGER, INTENT(in)  :: stepnow  ! Number of the current time step
  INTEGER, INTENT(out) :: nsteps_pdaf   ! Number of time steps until next obs
  INTEGER, INTENT(out) :: doexit   ! Whether to exit forecasting (1 for exit)
  REAL, INTENT(out)    :: time     ! Current model (physical) time

! !CALLING SEQUENCE:
! Called by: PDAF_get_state   (as U_next_obs)
